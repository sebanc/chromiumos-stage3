# ChromiumOS Stage3

## Overview

This project consist in creating a ChromiumOS Stage3 tarball that will be used to build brunch (it deprecates the Brunch toolchain that was difficult to maintain)

So that's all there is ?
Not necessarily, it also allows to create a gentoo prefix that can be used either in Brunch or ChromeOS developer mode:
xxxxxxxxxxxx
